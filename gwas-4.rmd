# MAGMA

The brower-based version of MAGMA is called FUMA:

<https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/fuma_gwas>

MAGMA is relatively easy to use (especially in browser version), but what is it actually doing behind the scenes?  Here are two papers:

* [MAGMA: Generalized gene-set analysis of GWAS data (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004219)
* [The statistical properties of gene-set analysis (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg.2016.29)

The first is the original MAGMA publication, but I would actually recommend reading the second one instead (or at least, first).  Both articles are written by the same primary group of authors; the second provides a better overview of the field, potential approaches, what MAGMA does differently than competing approaches, and why what MAGMA does is better.
