# Self-guided GWAS tutorial

This self-guided tutorial walks a beginner through a GWAS analysis, covering topics including: 

- Quality control 

- Imputation

- Marginal analysis 

- Joint analysis 

This is a work in progress, although hopefully still useful to people. Some pages are not finished yet, though. If you notice anything incorrect, please [file an issue](https://github.com/pbreheny/adv-gwas-tutorial/issues).
